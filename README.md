# genai-backend-k8s-autoscaling-observability
Production-style GenAI backend built with FastAPI, containerized with Docker, deployed on Kubernetes, horizontally autoscaled using CPU-based HPA, and monitored using Prometheus and Grafana. This project demonstrates end-to-end backend engineering, Kubernetes autoscaling, metrics-driven scaling decisions, and observability.
